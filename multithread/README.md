# longest palindromic subsequence

This program runs in O(n^2) time and uses O(1) space to find the longest palindromic subsequence of a string.
It utilises two threads to increase execution speed.
We find that for the string examined, the execution time comes to around 300 microseconds.

If we compare this to a similar program written in python, the execution time comes out as around 1000 microseconds.

I.E there is 3.3x time complexity reduction.
